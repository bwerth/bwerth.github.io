# Improving Public Transit Navigation for Vision Impaired People

Public transit is halfway to anywhere, and is currently an obstacle for people who are blind. Even sighted people have some trouble navigating Park Street, but for a person who is blind locating the entrance, correct platform, the bathroom, or the exit can be a real struggle. Additionally, the threat of walking into a moving train or falling off the platform is constantly looming in the background. We seek to remedy these identified problems by designing an improved user experience for vision impaired users.

# A Note on the Design of this Website for Accessibility

In considering the design, presentation, and layout of this website, it was important for us that the content be consumable by the visually impaired. To achieve this, we used a simple website design with integrated text alternatives for all visuals. Navigation of the website is as clear as possible with clearly labelled buttons, headers, and text.
