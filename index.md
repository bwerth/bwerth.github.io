# Improving Public Transit Navigation for Vision Impaired People

Public transit is halfway to anywhere, and is currently an obstacle for people who are blind. Even sighted people have some trouble navigating Park Street, but for a person who is blind locating the entrance, correct platform, the bathroom, or the exit can be a real struggle. Additionally, the threat of walking into a moving train or falling off the platform is constantly looming in the background. We seek to remedy these identified problems by designing an improved user experience for vision impaired users.
